# Translator's Usage

This app was inspired by Google Translate extension for Google Chrome and works the same. But now it can only translate Eng-Rus and vice-versa. It uses Google Translate under the hood. So make sure you are connected to the Internet.

1. Open any window in your PC, then select the text you want to translate.
2. Press Ctrl+T and app pops up showing you translated text.

Note! To make this app work it should be running, no matter as foreground or background process
